// this is the code as found on Vigna's site
// http://xoroshiro.di.unimi.it/xorshift128plus.c (last checked October 4th
// 2017)
// It is also the code that appears in
// Further scramblings of Marsagliaâ€™s xorshift generators
// http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/xorshiftplus.pdf
// Figure 1: The xorshift128+ generator used in the tests.
// Original documentation by Vigna :
/* This generator has been replaced by xoroshiro128plus, which is
   significantly faster and has better statistical properties.

   It might be nonetheless useful for languages in which low-level rotate
   instructions are not available. Due to the relatively short period it
   is acceptable only for applications with a mild amount of parallelism;
   otherwise, use a xorshift1024* generator.

   Note that the lowest bit of this generator is an LSFR, and thus it will
   fail binary rank tests. The next bit is not an LFSR, but in the long
   run it will fail binary rank tests, too. The other bits have no LFSR
   artifacts.

   We suggest to use a sign test to extract a random Boolean value.

   The state must be seeded so that it is not everywhere zero. If you have
   a 64-bit seed, we suggest to seed a splitmix64 generator and use its
   output to fill s.

   A previous version of this generator was adding the two halves of the
   newly computed state. This version adds the two halves of the *current*
   state (as xoroshiro128plus does), which improves speed due to better
   internal parallelization from the CPU. The resulting streams are off by
   one step. */
